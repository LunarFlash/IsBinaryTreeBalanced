# IsBinaryTreeBalanced

What is a balanced binary tree? It is a tree where the depth of all leaf nodes or nodes with single children differ by no more than one.

Self-balancing binary search trees can be used in a natural way to construct and maintain ordered lists, such as priority queues. They can also be used for associative arrays; key-value pairs are simply inserted with an ordering based on the key alone. In this capacity, self-balancing BSTs have a number of advantages (and disadvantages) over their main competitor, hash tables.
